/*
 * This is a voltmeter meant to tell you if ANY  battery is charged; It does
 * this by measuring the unloaded voltage of it and finding it's % by a
 *  * designated lower and upper bound. The % is not super accurate as it does
 * not * account for the flatline most batteries have when they are at ~90-30%.
 * Due to this, batteries are only considered "charged" if they're above 95%.
 *
 * The circuit consists of a voltage divider with a 1 : 1 ratio of
 * resistors, with the output connected to the A0 analog pin of the Arduino.
 * Due to this, the maximum battery voltage this can measure is 10V.
 * The LCD is connected to the arduino as shown in circuit.png.
